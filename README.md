# Practice Problem 3.3

1.

Ask to user for a positive integer (ensure that it is positive!).  If it is a negative number ask again.

Write a for loop that will output all even numbers between 0 and the given number on the same line, inclusive. (no spaces)

Sample input/outputs:

```
In: 5
```

```
024
```

```
In: 10
```

```
0246810
```

```
In: -10
```

```
In: -5
```

```
In: 8
```

```
02468
```

2.

Ask to user for a positive integer (ensure that it is positive!).  If it is a negative number ask again.

Write a for loop that will output a series of numbers starting at one less than the given number and ending at 0.


Sample input/outputs:

```
In: 7
6543210
```

```
In: -2
```

```
In: 12
11109876543210
```

```
In: 20
191817161514131211109876543210
```
